**Command lines are faster, hassle-free way of deploying software just as you want it with complete control of the userâ€™s system.**
 
I think, there lies the use, the necessity for having a command line tool for our favorite data validation and monitoring tool for Spiders that is Spidermon. A CLI has something for everyone. A developer wanting to configure say, his/her Sentry or Slack actions quickly, but not want to go deep into the code. Maintainers who want to add new features and test them quickly.  
 
In my plans for Spidermon, I aim to build a simple, well documented, feature-rich command line interface that developers would actually enjoy using and experimenting with their spiders. Helping developers and users alike to speed through setups of the spidermon library and its features. 

**Redefining the experience** of setting up spidermon in either pre-built spiders or in new projects. Providing **flexibility**, **scalability** and resulting in higher **production-ready, tested spiders** with **monitoring tools activated** coming out of development. I.

_I think this project is extremely beneficial for the growth of Spidermon as well as the entire ScrapingHub community._

Went through the Scrapy Issues and CLI 
Research 
https://github.com/wf94/BookSpider/wiki/How-scrapy-works

This CLI should be used by anyone that want to configure Spidermon quickly. I suggest the use of click to create the command.
Ask the user which built-in monitors they want to enable (and request the necessary settings):
https://github.com/scrapinghub/spidermon/blob/master/spidermon/contrib/scrapy/monitors.py
Ask the user which built-in actions they want to enable (and request the necessary settings):
https://github.com/scrapinghub/spidermon/tree/master/spidermon/contrib/actions
Ask the user if they want item validation (options JSON Schema or schematics).
In the end, a new monitors.py file should be created and project settings.py needs to be updated with the settings. If item validation was chosen, create an empty validators.py file or create a templa JSON Schema.
